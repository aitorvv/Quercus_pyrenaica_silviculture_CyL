It is derived by the interpolation of monthly climate anomalies from extensive networks of weather station observations. Here we describe the construction of a major new version, CRU TS v4. It is updated to span 1901–2018 by the inclusion of additional station observations, and it will be updated annually. The interpolation process has been changed to use angular-distance weighting (ADW), and the production of secondary variables has been revised to better suit this approach. This implementation of ADW provides improved traceability between each gridded value and the input observations, and allows more informative diagnostics that dataset users can utilise to assess how dataset quality might vary geographically.

The history of close to nature silviculture dates back to the second half of the 19th century, when the first attempts were made in Central Europe for more sophisticated silvicultural practices based on natural small-scale regeneration and management of mixed stands. These activities also affected the Czech lands, where the ideas of close to nature silviculture were successfully developed by the end of the 1960s. For the next twenty years, however, under the influence of central planning, forest management has been inclined towards large-scale clear cutting system. The renaissance of close to nature forest management took place only after 1989. At present, close to nature silviculture being established not only in Central Europe, but also more and more in the boreal part of Europe as well as in North America. Currently, there is a discussion about suitability of close-to-nature silviculture for adapting temperate forests to climate change.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The evaluation criteria included qualitative and quantitative examinations and a testing with independent data from another region. The generalized algebraic difference equation of Cieszewski based on Bailey equation showed the best results for the four stratums. An analysis of the height growth patterns among ecological stratums was made in order to study the necessity of different site index curves. Results indicated the validity of a common height growth model for the four stratums.

	doi = {10.5424/fs/2015243-06229},
	abstract = {This research was carried out in the region of Cas-tile-Leon, located in Central Spain. The region covers approximately 9.4 million ha and is one of the most important areas for timber production in Spain. Predominant oak stands cover more than half of the area, while pine stands cover one third of the area. Altitude fluctuates between 110 and 2650 m above sea level. The climate in Castile-Leon is both continental and Mediterranean: average winter temperatures range between 4 and 7 °C, while average summer temperatures range from 19 to 22 °C; with three or four dry summer months that are typical of a Mediterranean climate. Average annual rainfall is only 450 to 500 mm, mostly in lower altitudes. The data used in this study were collected in 242 public and private forests in Central Spain. Data from 1,844 Scots pines, 456 stone pines, 533 black pines, 1,715 Mediterranean maritime pines, 326 Spanish junipers, 302 Pyrenean oaks, 992 poplars and 189 beeches were used to test the statistical performance of the taper functions. Thus, a total of 6,357 trees were selected for destructive sampling using the protocol of Garber and Maguire (2003). The trees were felled from thinned and unthinned stands, which were subjectively selected to represent the existing range of site qualities. Before felling, two attributes were recorded for each sample tree: (i) diameter at breast height, D (to the nearest 0.1 cm); (ii) total tree height, H (to the nearest 0.01 m). Each sample tree was felled in a manner that minimized stem breakage. A tape measure was stretched along the bole and total height was recorded from the base of the stump to the top of the tree. The tree was divided into sections, and thin disks were removed for diameter measurements at the base of the stump; at 80 cm above the ground level; at breast height; and at a height midway between every other whorl pair above breast height (1-3 m intervals). For each disk, height (h, to the nearest 0.01 m) and diameter over bark (d, to the nearest 0.1 cm) were measured along two perpendicular axes. Log volumes in cubic meters were calculated using Smali-an's formula. The topmost log was considered conical in shape. Total volume (V in m 3) was obtained by summing the log volumes. Between 3 and 40 disks were cut per tree, for a total of 87,568 disks. Summary statistics including the number of observations , arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and minimum/maximum values of the main variables are presented in Table 1. merchantable volume equations derived from volume-ratio equations are very easy to use and develop, those obtained from taper functions are preferred nowadays; perhaps because they allow for estimation of diameter at a given height (Diéguez-Aranda et al., 2006). Compatibility means that an integrated model can be obtained through summation of the differential model. Thus, for a given merchantable volume equation , there is an intrinsically defined compatible taper function (Clutter, 1980). This implies that integration of the taper function from the ground to the top of the tree would provide the appropriate volume, and subsequently the merchantable volume equation (Fang et al., 2000). Existing research indicates that segmented models appear to be more accurate than other model formulations (e.g., Corral-Rivas et al., 2007) for creating compatible systems. To develop a taper function, diameter/height data pairs are required along the stem. Most taper functions can be included in the following groups: single and segmented taper models, trigonometric equations, and variable-form taper models. Stem taper functions are usually based on the diameter at breast height (dbh), and predict diameter over bark (Rojo et al., 2005; Crecente-Campo et al., 2009); though they can also predict diameter inside bark (Garber \& Maguire, 2003; Calama \& Montero, 2006) and bark thickness (Laasa-senaho et al., 2005). Forestry researchers in Spain have been developing taper equations since the 1970s. Recently, a considerable number of taper equations have been developed for particular regions and species: some for hardwoods but most for softwoods (Bravo et al., 2011). Due to their complicated formulations, most taper functions are implemented with specific software in order to estimate total and merchantable volume from inventory data (e.g. SiManFor; www.simanfor.es). In central Spain, most harvested tree species are Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Mediterranean maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.), Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyr-enaica Willd.), poplar (Populus x euramericana (Dode) Guinier), stone pine (Pinus pinea L.), Spanish juniper (Juniperus thurifera L.), black pine (Pinus nigra Ar-nold.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). According to the Spanish National Forest Inventory (SNFI) in Central Spain these species occupy around 1,742,975 ha, have a standing volume of approximately 113,437,012 m 3 and produce an annual harvest of about 1,274,594 m 3. The objective of this study was to compare a stem taper function and a compatible merchantable volume system to ascertain which provides a better description of the stem profile, in order to obtain accurate partial or total stem volume estimates for the main species in the Spanish plateau (central Spain).},

	abstract = {{\textbackslash}textlessp{\textbackslash}textgreater Adapting forests to climate change is a critical issue for forest management. It requires an understanding of climate effects on forest systems and the ability to forecast how these effects may change over time. We used Spanish Second National Forest Inventory data and the SIMANFOR platform to simulate the evolution of CO ₂ stock (CO ₂ Mg · ha $^{\textrm{−1}}$ ) and accumulation rates (CO ₂ Mg · ha $^{\textrm{−1}}$ · year $^{\textrm{−1}}$ ) for the 2000–2100 period in pure and mixed stands managed under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) in Spain. We hypothesized that (1) the more optimistic climate scenarios (SSP1 \&gt; \&gt; SSP5) would have higher CO ₂ stock and accumulation rates; (2) mixed stands would have higher CO ₂ stock and accumulation rates than pure stands; and (3) the behavior of both variables would vary based on forest composition (conifer–conifer vs. conifer–broadleaf). We focused on {\textbackslash}textlessitalic{\textbackslash}textgreaterPinus sylvestris{\textbackslash}textless/italic{\textbackslash}textgreater L., and its main mixtures with {\textbackslash}textlessitalic{\textbackslash}textgreaterPinus nigra{\textbackslash}textless/italic{\textbackslash}textgreater , {\textbackslash}textlessitalic{\textbackslash}textgreaterPinus pinaster{\textbackslash}textless/italic{\textbackslash}textgreater , {\textbackslash}textlessitalic{\textbackslash}textgreaterFagus sylvatica{\textbackslash}textless/italic{\textbackslash}textgreater and {\textbackslash}textlessitalic{\textbackslash}textgreaterQuercus pyrenaica{\textbackslash}textless/italic{\textbackslash}textgreater . The SSP scenarios had correlating CO ₂ stock values in which SSP1 \&gt; SSP2 \&gt; SSP3 \&gt; SSP5, ranging from the most optimistic (SSP1) to the most pessimistic (SSP5). Though pure stands had higher CO ₂ stock at the beginning, differences with regard to mixed stands were drastically reduced at the end of the simulation period. We also found an increase in the aboveground CO ₂ proportion compared to belowground in conifer–broadleaf mixtures, while the opposite trend occurred in conifer–conifer mixtures. Overall CO ₂ accumulation rates decreased significantly from the beginning to the end of the simulation period, but our results indicated that this decline would be less drastic in mixed stands than in pure ones. At the end of the simulation period, CO ₂ accumulation rates were higher in mixed stands than in pure stands for all mixtures, fractions (aboveground and belowground) and SSPs. Knowing the evolution of mixed forests in different climate scenarios is relevant for developing useful silvicultural guidelines in the Mediterranean region and optimizing forestry adaptation strategies. Better understanding can also inform the design of management measures for transitioning from pure stands to more resource efficient, resistant and resilient mixed stands, in efforts to reduce forest vulnerability in the face of climate change. This work highlights the importance and benefits of mixed stands in terms of CO ₂ accumulation, stand productivity and species diversity. {\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

There were also significant differences in BD between the tissues (heartwood{\textbackslash}textgreatersapwood{\textbackslash}textgreaterbark), and the BD was higher in Q. petraea than in Q. pyrenaica. Both \%C and BD varied along the stem. • Conclusion More accurate estimates of carbon contents were obtained by using specific values for different heights and anatomical parts, than by using single values. © INRA/Springer-Verlag France 2012.},

The climate change research community is developing new scenarios integrating future changes in climate and society to investigate climate impacts as well as options for mitigation and adaptation. One component of these new scenarios is a set of alternative futures of societal development known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The conceptual framework for the design and use of the SSPs calls for the development of global pathways describing the future evolution of key aspects of society that would together imply a range of challenges for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Here we present one component of these pathways: the SSP narratives, a set of five qualitative descriptions of future changes in demographics, human development, economy and lifestyle, policies and institutions, technology, and environment and natural resources. We describe the methods used to develop the narratives as well as how these pathways are hypothesized to produce particular combinations of challenges to mitigation and adaptation. Development of the narratives drew on expert opinion to (1) identify key determinants of these challenges that were essential to incorporate in the narratives and (2) combine these elements in the narratives in a manner consistent with scholarship on their inter-relationships. The narratives are intended as a description of plausible future conditions at the level of large world regions that can serve as a basis for integrated scenarios of emissions and land use, as well as climate impact, adaptation and vulnerability analyses.},

Total merchantable cubic-foot yields are highest for conventionally managed even-aged plantations; sawtimber cubic-foot yields are highest for intensively managed even-aged plantations and intensively managed uneven-aged stands. However, uneven-aged stands have higher board-foot sawtimber yields than the most productive even-aged stands, particularly in comparisons using the Doyle log rule. It is hypothesized that the even-aged plantations have higher cubic-foot yields because they are more fully stocked with trees of merchantable size. Conversely, the uneven-aged stands have higher board-foot yields because of the greater proportion and continuous supply of sawtimber basal area, especially in stems of large size, which can be developed using the uneven-aged selection method.

	abstract = {Growth and yield modeling has a long history in forestry. Methods of measuring the growth of uneven-aged forest stands have evolved from those developed in France and Switzerland during the last century. Furthermore, uneven-aged growth and yield modeling has progressed rapidly since the first models were pioneered by Moser and Hall (1969) (Moser Jr., J.W., Hall, O.F., 1969. For. Sci. 15, 183–188). Over the years, a variety of models have been developed for predicting the growth and yield of uneven-aged stands using both individual and stand-level approaches. Modeling methodology not only has moved from an empirical approach to a more ecological process-based mechanistic approach, but also has incorporated a variety of techniques, such as, (1) systems of equations, (2) nonlinear stand table projections, (3) Markov chains, (4) matrix models, and (5) artificial neural network models. However, modeling the growth and yield of uneven-aged stands has received much less attention than that of even-aged stands. This paper reviews the current literature regarding growth and yield models for uneven-aged stands, discusses basic types of models and their merits, and reports recent progress in modeling the growth and dynamics of uneven-aged stands. Furthermore, future trends involving integration of new computer technologies (object-oriented programming and user-friendly interfaces), tree visualization techniques, and the spatially explicit application of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) into uneven-aged modeling strategies are discussed.},

	abstract = {This study evaluated the basal area growth of Norway spruce stands subjected to different management strategies; specifically, even-aged (EA) stands treated with thinning from below and uneven-aged (UEA) stands treated with selective cutting. Analysis was based on extensive empirical data obtained from permanent long-term experiments established in 23 even-aged and 26 uneven-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands in Southern and Central Finland. The specific goals were to determine whether there are differences in: (a) the relationship between the stocking level and the stand basal area growth, (b) the stand basal area growth rates at a given stocking level, and (c) the stand basal area growth responses to cuttings between EA and UEA stands. A model-based approach was adopted in the analysis. Modelling was used to describe general trends and patterns in the data, emphasising the effects of overall stand density, cutting intensity, and management strategy on post-treatment stand growth. A model for a stand basal-area growth was fitted as a mixed linear model to the pooled data from EA and UEA stands. Model simulations were conducted to elucidate how the treatment of stands affects the predicted stand basal area growth. The analysis revealed a clear general effect of stocking level on stand basal area growth for all data. Growth increased with increasing stocking density. There was a significant difference in the stand basal area growth of EA stands and UEA stands. The growth of UEA stands was ca. 20\% smaller than that of EA stands. There were also major differences in the timing and magnitude of the growth response to cutting between EA and UEA stands. Post treatment growth was noticeably slower in UEA stands than in EA stands, especially during the first 10 years after cutting. The results clearly show that the growth response of the trees remaining in EA stands is faster and greater than that in UEA stands, enhancing the stand basal area growth.},

This study provides a framework for simulating conversion of mature even-aged stands to uneven-aged slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) stands using the USDA Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) model. A total of 73 scenarios, representing combinations of two harvest methods (based on either “BDq” and/or “low thinning”), two harvesting cycles (10 or 20 years), three harvest intensities (4.6 or 8.0 or 11.5 m2 ha−1 residual basal areas), and six levels of regeneration (0–2,224 seedlings ha−1) were evaluated for structural diversity, timber production, and carbon (C) stocks over a 100-year period. The BDq harvest approach, which applied selection cutting based on diameter regulation from the first cutting cycle onwards, resulted in higher structural diversity. Scenarios based on low thinning in the first cutting cycle and BDq method from the third cutting cycle onwards tended to result in higher total merchantable timber and C stocks over the entire simulation period, particularly at higher residual basal areas and longer cutting cycles. None of the scenarios maximized all of the three variables simultaneously. Based on the desired objectives, land managers can choose among scenarios presented. The study revealed that regeneration and establishment of as low as 247 seedlings ha−1 can lead to successful conversion and multiple benefits from uneven-aged slash pine stands.},

This will require an extended time as managers partition the cut of original trees in periodically establishing new age classes and maintaining the vigor of ones that develop. Strategies might include forms of uniform partial cutting, or patch cutting combined with thinning. The approach depends upon the shade tolerance and regeneration potential of the component species. Also, the limited growth potential of original trees that occupied poor crown positions will force landowners to rely on the dominants and co-dominants as residual growing stock during the conversion of most even-aged stands. Stratified mixed-species stands would allow a different approach. While experience suggests some clear options for the first entry towards conversion, later cuttings are more difficult to envision at present.},

	abstract = {For the first time, an economic analysis of a fully simulated forest transformation process from even-aged to uneven-aged stand structure using natural regeneration was performed using an individual tree growth simulator. A comparison to a ‘business as usual’ management approach (i.e. age-class scenario) was also made. Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.)-dominated forests of different ages were selected for the simulation: forest at thinning stage (52 years; hereafter, ‘younger stand’) and a mature stand (95 years) to explore different starting points for the transformation.The harvested and remaining stand volume showed only little fluctuation over the course of the simulation period in the case of the transformation (uneven-aged) scenario. The age-class scenario, on the other hand, showed peaks and drops in the timber volume.The land expectation values at the end of transformation were higher (i = 1 or 2 per cent) or equal (i = 3 per cent) to those of the age-class scenario for the younger stand. The transformation of younger forests appears to be economically interesting (under interest rates above 2 per cent) as the early revenues of more intensive thinnings achieve an equilibrium growing stock well below the potential maximum growing stock of an even-aged stand. This suggests transformation management to be economically efficient under the given silvicultural and economic conditions. The transformation of mature stands was found to be less economically viable due to the lower holding values for the transformation (uneven-aged) scenario compared with the age-class scenario. However, the holding values of the younger stand were higher for all interest rates compared with the age-class scenario.This study concludes that transformation (uneven-aged) scenario yielded more economically viable silvicultural approach (in the case of younger forests) and a steadier trend in harvested and remaining timber volume showing no major fluctuations. Transformation approach also forms a better foundation where other ecosystem services can be built.},

	abstract = {The paper provides a conversion regime from even-aged to uneven-aged stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.). The conversion regime was tested by the distance-dependent single-tree simulator SILVA 2.1. The initial data for the simulation and the assumed site productivity were deduced using inventory data of the north Black Forest. The conversion regime was compared to a typical future-tree oriented age–class treatment system. Thereby four variants of the conversion regime, differing in the number and diameter of the ‘regeneration-funnels’ (gaps in the canopy of the stand) which were created during the ‘graded-regeneration-phase’, were compared to a basal-area oriented future-tree age–class treatment. A simulation-run of 110 years — divided into 22 periods of five years — was conducted. The analysis of the simulation-run showed that the possibilities to achieve uneven-aged structures in single-layered, even-aged stands through ‘structuring measures’ during thinning or target–diameter harvesting were very limited. The success of the conversion depended mainly on the success of the regeneration during the conversion. The early creation of ‘regeneration-funnels’ was linked to severe losses in increment and standing volume. As well as influences on different stand-parameters (e.g. stem-distribution) changes in structure-parameters caused by the conversion could be assessed. In particular, the modified Shannon-index did react distinctly to the implementation of the natural regeneration in the regeneration-funnels. Indeed, a steady state was only temporarily reached with the variant with the largest gaps. Finally, the results of the conversion experiment were subject to a critical review. Thus, the limits of the model in its current version and further research needs were discussed.},

After tracking the fates of 21 338 trees in a network of old-growth forest plots in the Sierra Nevada of California, we found that mortality rate, but not the recruitment rate, increased significantly over the 22 years of measurement (1983–2004). Mortality rates increased in both of two dominant taxonomic groups (Abies and Pinus) and in different forest types (different elevational zones). The increase in overall mortality rate resulted from an increase in tree deaths attributed to stress and biotic causes, and coincided with a temperature-driven increase in an index of drought. Our findings suggest that these forests (and by implication, other water-limited forests) may be sensitive to temperature-driven drought stress, and may be poised for die-back if future climates continue to feature rising temperatures without compensating increases in precipitation.},

Increases were also pervasive across elevations, tree sizes, dominant genera, and past fire histories. Forest density and basal area declined slightly, which suggests that increasing mortality was not caused by endogenous increases in competition. Because mortality increased in small trees, the overall increase in mortality rates cannot be attributed solely to aging of large trees.

During this period, tree mortality increased by an order of magnitude, typically from tens to hundreds of dead trees per km2, rising dramatically during the fourth year of drought. Mortality rates increased independently with average CWD and with basal area, and they increased disproportionately in areas that were both dry and dense.

	abstract = {Pulses of tree mortality caused by drought have been reported recently in forests around the globe, but large-scale quantitative evidence is lacking for Europe. Analyzing high-resolution annual satellite-based canopy mortality maps from 1987 to 2016 we here show that excess forest mortality (i.e., canopy mortality exceeding the long-term mortality trend) is significantly related to drought across continental Europe. The relationship between water availability and mortality showed threshold behavior, with excess mortality increasing steeply when the integrated climatic water balance from March to July fell below −1.6 standard deviations of its long-term average. For −3.0 standard deviations the probability of excess canopy mortality was 91.6\% (83.8–97.5\%). Overall, drought caused approximately 500,000 ha of excess forest mortality between 1987 and 2016 in Europe. We here provide evidence that drought is an important driver of tree mortality at the continental scale, and suggest that a future increase in drought could trigger widespread tree mortality in Europe.},

	abstract = {Accurate and representative prediction of ingrowth is essential for modeling forest development. Besides the number of ingrowth trees, the basic tree attributes diameter and species are also important. In this study, these three characteristics were modeled based on data from the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI). The study covered large gradients of stand conditions and climate variables, making the models suitable to predict ingrowth under climate change. As the number of ingrowth trees per plot included more zeros than is expected for a Poisson distribution, we used three alternative probability distributions: zero-inflated Poisson distribution (ZIP), negative binomial distribution (NB) and zero-inflated negative binomial distribution (ZINB). Models with each of the three variants were fitted with and without random effects, resulting in six different model types. Model selection was performed backward using the BIC criterion. Of the final models, ZIP showed the best predictions of independently observed number of ingrowth trees. Our results indicate that the number of ingrowth trees strongly depended on the development stage of forests and on stand basal area, while temperature and precipitation, nitrogen deposition and water holding capacity each had a lower but still significant and plausible effect. The Weibull function was used to describe the probability distribution of the diameter of ingrowth trees and parameters were estimated using the Likelihood approach. The diameter of ingrowth trees was larger where there was a better site index and decreased with increasing stand density. Further, twelve species groups of ingrowth trees were fitted with a multinomial regression approach and showed clear dependence on climate: the probability of spruce and larch ingrowth clearly decreased with increasing temperature, whilst all other tree species profited from warmer conditions. The probability of fir, beech and ash ingrowth increased with increasing basal area, demonstrating the relevance of shade tolerance. The most important variable for predicting the species of ingrowth was the leading tree species group in a plot.},

	abstract = {European beech is the dominant native tree species in sub-mountain and mountain zones of the European continent and provides multiple ecosystem services to European society. However, the mountain zone is strongly affected by environmental change. Here, we explore the long-term natural dynamics of European beech-dominated old-growth forests in the Western Carpathians, Central Europe. We use fifty-year measurements of forest stand dynamics from eleven nature reserves strictly protected from any management (some of them included in the UNESCO natural heritage program). The study sites cover a typical range of natural conditions of the beech-dominated altitudinal zone in the Western Carpathians. The database includes long-term pair-wise non-destructive measurements of nearly 3.000 beeches from 1970 through 2019. We aim to investigate three crucial processes of beech forest dynamics: increment, ingrowth, and mortality of beech trees. The results, besides expected interactions, indicated a statistically significant change in radial increment and tree mortality during the study period. The radial increment increased, whereas tree mortality decreased during the past decades. Our findings indicate that European beech has strengthened the role of the most vital and competitive tree species in the elevational range from sub-mountain to mountain zone of Central European mountains during the last 50 years. The species increases the potential of enlarging its current distribution and outcompeting other species at the upper as well as lower elevational range edges. The assumed reasons for such development considering postglacial vegetation development in Europe and upcoming climate change are discussed. Possible implications and ways how to utilize the observed findings in close-to-nature forest management are suggested.},

	abstract = {Past failures of monocultures, caused by wind-throw or insect damages, and ongoing climate change currently strongly stimulate research into mixed-species stands. So far, the focus has mainly been on combinations of species with obvious complementary functional traits. However, for any generalization, a broad overview of the mixing reactions of functionally different tree species in different mixing proportions, patterns and under different site conditions is needed, including assemblages of species with rather similar demands on resources such as light. Here, we studied the growth of Scots pine and oak in mixed versus monospecific stands on 36 triplets located along a productivity gradient across Europe, reaching from Sweden to Spain and from France to Georgia. The set-up represents a wide variation in precipitation (456–1250 mm year−1), mean annual temperature (6.7–11.5 °C) and drought index by de Martonne (21–63 mm °C−1). Stand inventories and increment cores of trees stemming from 40- to 132-year-old, fully stocked stands on 0.04–0.94-ha-sized plots provided insight into how species mixing modifies stand growth and structure compared with neighbouring monospecific stands. On average, the standing stem volume was 436 and 360 m3 ha−1 in the monocultures of Scots pine and oak, respectively, and 418 m3 ha−1 in the mixed stands. The corresponding periodical annual volume increment amounted to 10.5 and 9.1 m3 ha−1 year−1 in the monocultures and 10.5 m3 ha−1 year−1 in the mixed stands. Scots pine showed a 10\% larger quadratic mean diameter (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05), a 7\% larger dominant diameter (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.01) and a 9\% higher growth of basal area and volume in mixed stands compared with neighbouring monocultures. For Scots pine, the productivity advantages of growing in mixture increased with site index (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.01) and water supply (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.01), while for oak they decreased with site index (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.01). In total, the superior productivity of mixed stands compared to monocultures increased with water supply (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.10). Based on 7843 measured crowns, we found that in mixture both species, but especially oak, had significantly wider crowns (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001) than in monocultures. On average, we found relatively small effects of species mixing on stand growth and structure. Scots pine benefiting on rich, and oak on poor sites, allows for a mixture that is productive and most likely climate resistant all along a wide ecological gradient. We discuss the potential of this mixture in view of climate change.},

	abstract = {The sustainability of shade-intermediate tree species such as Douglas fir in complex forest structures (with more than two distinct storeys) has been controversially discussed for a long time and traditionally shade-tolerant tree species have been preferred in plenter forest management. The most critical question in this context is whether recruitment trees of a particular species can survive in the shady conditions of the understorey and whether they can contribute to a demographic continuity. Using data from the unique, replicated monitoring site Artist’s Wood in North Wales (UK) we investigated the recruitment dynamics of Douglas fir to address the question whether this species can grow in complex forest structures on a long-term basis. Then we compared the results with those from Norway spruce and silver fir plenter forests in the Swiss Jura. Demographic continuity in complex structures is ensured if all forest development stages are represented in appropriate demographic proportions. We quantified these development stages in terms of stem diameter classes and analysed the corresponding diameter growth, competition and the loss of trees due to mortality and forest management. Based on this analysis we determined demographic equilibrium conditions for Artist’s Wood. The results confirmed that Douglas fir at Artist’s Wood can indeed grow sustainably in complex forest structures at a stand density of 27.4m2 ha−1 basal area which corresponds to a standing volume of 342m3 ha−1. However, equilibrium conditions for Douglas fir can only be achieved at the expense of a lower overall stand density of approximately 85\% of that of Norway spruce. Despite this the corresponding Douglas fir stand volume increment of 15.3m3 ha−1 year−1 is greater than that of Norway spruce. Thus Douglas fir plenter forests are not only possible but are also appealing considering the broad site amplitude of the species in conjunction with ongoing climate change and the potential of the species for CO2 retention.},

	abstract = {Mulching is frequently used to reduce runoff and erosion following high-severity wildfires. In commercial forest stands, post-fire salvage logging is common practice, although it can lead to increased erosion losses in recently burned areas. Field research concerning the effects of post-fire salvage logging on sediment production is limited and the effects of clearcutting in areas previously treated by mulching are not known. In this study, 36 experimental plots were established in three experimental sites affected by crown fires that caused moderate-high soil burn severity in the summer of 2013. Immediately after the fire, bark strands mulch was applied in 18 of the plots. Salvage logging took place at the end of the first winter following fire. Post logging treatments were: mulching+salvage logging, no mulching+salvage logging and no mulching+no logging. The objectives of the study were to determine whether mulching mitigates soil erosion caused by fire and salvage logging and also to assess the possible effects of wildfire and salvage logging, with and without mulching, on vegetation recovery. During the six month period lapsed between the wildfire and salvage logging, precipitation was higher than the annual mean in the area, and the average soil loss in the untreated burned soils was 18.5Mgha−1. In that period, mulching significantly reduced soil loss (84\%). In the 18-month period following salvage logging and in the absence of mulch, there was no increase in erosion due to logging (8.7Mgha−1) compared with the unlogged treatment (7.0Mgha−1) whereas mulching reduced significantly soil losses even after logging (2.3Mgha−1). Neither mulching nor salvage logging had any detrimental effects on the regeneration of natural vegetation. Our results showed that the mulching just after a fire can substantially reduce the subsequent erosion due to post-fire salvage logging without any significant adverse effects on vegetative regrowth. In addition, leaving the standing burned trees seemed not to be a feasible management option to reduce post-fire erosion and enhance vegetation recovery in those kind of stands.},

	abstract = {The development of a mixed-species irregular stand in the latter stages of transformation was examined. Transformation of the stand, located in Faskally Forest, Scotland, began over 60 years ago and it is now managed under the selection system. The aim was to determine whether a sustainable irregular state has been reached based on a stable diameter distribution, basal area and stand increment and on whether sufficient regeneration of the desired species and recruitment into the canopy is present to maintain the distribution. Complete inventories at 6-year intervals were carried out in a 1-ha permanent sample plot established in 1997. Results from the 2009 inventory suggest that the stand has not reached a sustainable irregular condition based on the above criteria. A reduction in canopy tree number in the last harvesting intervention has slightly flattened the diameter distribution (q = 1.4 cf. 1.5 and 1.6 in 2003 and 1997 inventories, respectively). The reduction in overhead cover has increased the number of regenerating seedlings in the understorey and suggests that the stand is moving towards a more balanced structure. Shade-tolerant western hemlock and beech dominate the understorey followed by semi-shade-tolerant Douglas-fir and Norway spruce. Recommendations for future management are discussed.},

The Trial Area was established in 1952 when most of the plantations were 20–30 years old. The 117-ha area was divided into six Blocks and the plan was to transform the area over a 60-year period by felling and regenerating groups totalling 2 ha in each Block every 6 years. The objectives of this paper are (1) to examine the design, implementation and monitoring of the process of transformation and (2) to investigate if the data collected can be used to quantify the progress of transformation to an irregular structure. The Trial Area has been driven by a clear objective but unfortunately the management plan has not been revised and there has not been a consistent approach to record keeping. This has made it difficult to relate management interventions to the development of the forest structure. An earlier analysis claimed that transformation was almost complete; this was based on a comparison of diameter distributions of the 1990 data with an exponential regression. However, the analysis in this paper includes all the data collected between 1952 and 1990 and shows that the diameter distribution of all Blocks has been similar to an exponential since the start of the Trial. The main reason for this is that the monitoring unit has been the Block, and a spatial scale of ∼20 hectares is probably too coarse to detect the changes that are clear in aerial photographs.},

Climate change is, however, expected to change growth conditions—possibly quite radically. Using a deterministic approach, it was the objective of this study to investigate the influence of such changes on optimal transformation strategies for an even-aged stand of European Beech in Denmark. For a range of growth change scenarios, represented by changes in site index, optimal harvest policies were determined using a matrix modelling approach and a differential evolution algorithm. Transition probabilities were updated continuously based on stand level variables and the transition matrix was thus dynamic. With optimal transformation policies, stand development followed similar pathways during the transformation phase irrespective of climate change scenario. Optimal transformation policies were thus robust, suggesting that a good policy would work well under different outcomes of climate change, i.e., acting under erroneous assumptions about change would not lead to major economic loss. For the chosen case stand, the net present value (NPV) of the transformation phase (first 100 years) contributed 80–90 \% of the total expectation value at a 2 \% discount rate. To assess the robustness of the optimisation procedure and understand the nature of the response surface, 100 replications per scenario were carried out. Variation between replications peaked during the later stages of the transformation phase indicating several pathways for transformation, which were characterised by almost identical levels of profitability.},

Application of SDI in uneven-aged stands has been described mathematically but not justified biologically. Diameter-class trends in SDI and sapwood area across 14 uneven-aged ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. \& C. Laws.) stands in eastern Montana were examined to elucidate the biological underpinnings of the SDI summation method. Results indicate that the SDI summation method is biased in its apportionment of relative stand density across diameter classes in uneven-aged ponderosa pine stands. SDI apportions greater relative density to small trees than to larger ones. Therefore, SDI may overpredict site occupancy for reverse J-shaped diameter distributions with more small trees than large ones, and it may underpredict occupancy with nonreverse J-shaped diameter distributions. Application of the SDI summation method in uneven-aged ponderosa pine stands may be biologically justified only if site occupancy – diameter-class trends are taken into account when interpreting SDI values. Replacing the self-thinning scaling factor of the SDI summation method with more biologically relevant scaling relationships may create improved relative density measures for uneven-aged stands.},

Here, we focus on rear-edge populations of Quercus pyrenaica in Sierra Nevada (southern Iberian Peninsula) to analyze their ecological and floristic diversity. We perform multivariate analyses using high-resolution environmental information and forest inventories to determine how environmental variables differ among oak populations, and to identify population groups based on environmental and floristic composition. We find that water availability is a key variable in explaining the distribution of Q. pyrenaica and the floristic diversity of their accompanying communities within its rear edge. Three cluster of oak populations were identified based on environmental variables. We found differences among these clusters regarding plant diversity, but not for forest attributes. A remarkable match between the populations clustering derived from analysis of environmental variables and the ordination of the populations according to species composition was found. The diversity of ecological behaviors for Q. pyrenaica populations in this rear edge are consistent with the high genetic diversity shown by populations of this oak in the Sierra Nevada. The identification of differences between oak populations within the rear-edge with respect to environmental variables can aid with planning the forest management and restoration actions, particularly considering the importance of some environmental factors in key ecological aspects.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	title = {Estado hídrico y crecimiento en brinzales de \textit{{Quercus} petraea} ({Mattuschka}) {Liebl}. y \textit{{Quercus} pyrenaica} {Willd}. con diferente alometría en tres ambientes},
	abstract = {Muchas de las repoblaciones forestales en la cuenca mediterránea presentan abundantes marras durante el periodo estival. El problema puede ser aún más manifiesto cuando el material vegetal presenta un claro desequilibrio entre la parte aérea y subterránea al tener más superficie transpirante con relación al sistema radical. El objetivo de este trabajo es analizar el posible efecto de la alometría de la planta en su estado hídrico y crecimiento, en función de la especie y el ambiente de plantación. Para ello se ha llevado a cabo un experimento en el que plantas de Quercus petraea y Q. pyrenaica se cultivaron en vivero en envases de distinta profundidad, y sometidas a la misma fertilización y riego. Esto permitió generar plantas con una marcada diferencia entre las proporciones de biomasa aérea y subterránea. Se establecieron ocho grupos según la especie, longitud del sistema radical y desarrollo de la parte aérea. En el segundo año, los brinzales fueron plantados en Montejo de la Sierra (Madrid) en tres ambientes: una zona de matorral, un pinar de elevada densidad y otro previamente aclarado. Los tratamientos se replicaron dos veces por ambiente. El estado de desarrollo de las plantas en el momento de plantación condicionó el crecimiento durante el primer año. El ambiente influyó en la distribución de biomasa dando lugar a plantas de menor altura, tallo de mayor grosor y con mayor ramificación, así como menor potencial hídrico al mediodía en la zona de matorral. Palabras clave: desequilibrio raíz-tallo, roble, crecimiento, fluorescencia de la clorofila, potencial hídrico INTRODUCCIÓN Las repoblaciones con planta de baja talla son poco aconsejables debido a la competencia por la luz con la vegetación que les rodea, además, su tamaño suele estar provocado por una baja calidad nutricional, lo que dificulta aún mas su crecimiento (PUÉRTOLAS et al., 2004). Si bien en plantaciones con material de mayor tamaño cabe evitarse este problema, la desproporción con respecto al sistema radical puede afectar su estado hídrico disminuyendo la supervivencia, incluso en zonas húmedas (JOBIDON et al., 1998). En ecosistemas mediterráneos la sequía estival es el principal condicionante del éxito de las repoblaciones forestales. Por ello es aún más importante plantar árboles con suficiente equilibrio entre la parte aérea y subterránea que asegure el abastecimiento de agua a las hojas, cuando las reservas hídricas de los horizontes superficiales del suelo se reducen por debajo del umbral de absorción de la planta a causa de la sequía estival. Las especies del género Quercus tienen en general una estrategia de crecimiento conservativa en la que prima la formación de un sistema radical profundo frente al crecimiento de la parte aérea, lo que supone una ventaja competitiva frente a especies con raíces más someras, al mantener la capacidad fotosintética durante periodos secos (WILSON \& HANSON, 2003). La escasez de repoblaciones con frondosas del género Quercus en la Península Ibérica hasta hace poco tiempo, ha motivado que los métodos de cultivo hayan descuidado su morfología. El éxito de las repoblaciones podría residir en plantar material que respetase la tendencia de estas especies mediante la producción de planta en vivero en contenedores de mayor longitud que la estándar para favorecer el crecimiento de la raíz principal. De este modo las plantas podrían acceder a niveles edáficos profundos con mayor contenido en humedad, reduciéndose la competencia con la vegetación accesoria.},

	abstract = {We assessed the process of carbon (C) accumulation as a consequence of forest expansion in abandoned agricultural lands over the period 1977–2017 in a vast (9.4 million ha) area of Mediterranean continental environment in Central-North Spain. We achieved this objective, through obtaining AGC and BGC estimations based on direct field measurements taken in 30 plots (25 m × 25 m), and extrapolating to the landscape using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data from 2018. Using aerial photographs and forest maps, we found that 145,193 ha of agricultural land in 1957 (1.54\% of the study regions’ total area) has since then regenerated naturally to forests and woodlands. Although mean AGC and BGC densities were modest (i.e. 18.04 and 6.78 Mg C ha−1), they reached relatively large maximum values (i.e. 60 and 21 Mg C ha−1). The BGC stock was also very large, representing 37.3\% of the total C stock (10 Tg) accumulated. However, we detected a mean annual C sink of 0.25 Tg C·year−1 which barely offset 1.22\% of the total regional CO2 emissions. Our findings point to a smaller sequestration potential under Mediterranean continental than under temperate-cold conditions. Nonetheless, the area affected by this process could be larger than detected and many of the recovering lands might have not still reached their C uptake peak. If such lands are to be used to store C, we strongly advocate for the application of active forest management measures to increase their CO2 sequestration potential.},

The main aim of this research is to implement a methodology integrating landscape dynamics and wildfire risk from a context-specific approach, to identify current fire scenarios at a regional scale in the Spanish Central Mountain Range. These homogeneous areas are linked to different stages of a territorial dynamics model called wildfire generations and related to land use diversity and land management trends. A place-based methodology has been developed to characterize fire scenarios using Geographic Information Systems and statistical analysis, resulting in analytical and diagnostic mapping that can be used as a decision support tool for spatial planning and wildfire risk management. Its implementation has led to the delimitation of 91 discrete geographic units in the Central Mountain Range, classified according to wildfire generations and land use-land cover criteria. In conclusion, the fire scenarios concept is a potential approach to manage uncertainty by moving from the operational level of fire suppression to the strategic level of integrated fire management.},

Nowadays, there is a strong need to consider a wider diversity of tree species, as evidenced by the impact of climate change and the forest health crises over the past decades. In this context, this study focuses on the potential of birch (Betula pendula Roth and Betula pubescens Ehrh.), a neglected indigenous species, for forestry and the forest-based industry sector. We have therefore compiled, analyzed, and discussed literature regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the species and the opportunities and threats of its use for this purpose. Among the strengths, birch tolerates various climates and sites, and high genetic variability promotes its adaptability. Birch improves forest resilience by colonizing forest gaps and quickly increasing soil functioning and biodiversity. Birch is also remarkably resistant to game overpopulation-associated damage. Large-sized logs are produced within relatively short periods with proper silvicultural treatment, and the wood characteristics allow versatile and valuable uses, as shown in Northern Europe. However, its weaknesses include high sensitivity to crown competition and to wood rot as challenges for silviculture. Among the opportunities, birch is well-suited to the global changes with its adaptability to climate change and its possible integration in diverse productive mixed tree stands. In the context of societal evolutions and customer perceptions, birch wood could play an increasing role in the building and furniture sectors, and among non-wood forest products. In Western Europe, the main obstacle to birch development is the lack of information on the wood uses and, consequently, the lack of interest among forest managers and wood processing professionals, which have led to a poor quality of the resource and to insufficient demand for its wood. Moreover, its fast height growth can affect the vitality of other species in mixed stands. Our analysis highlighted the potential of birch in the Western European forestry considering societal, ecological, and economic purposes in a changing climatic and socio-economic context and the need to (i) develop opportunities for industrial uses of birch wood, (ii) inform forest owners, managers, and industrial professionals about the potential value of birch, and (iii) define silvicultural guidelines.},

	abstract = {Because forests provide a myriad of essential services to society, sustainable forest management that considers and promotes the multifunctional role of forests is of key importance. Understanding how forests have been and are being managed is essential to learn how current forest landscapes have been shaped and how management could be improved to better address all societal needs. Spain makes for an interesting case study due to its dramatic expansion in forest cover over the last 150 years following ambitious national reforestation and afforestation initiatives, as well as for its diversity of forest ecosystems and management approaches. However, a national-level assessment of such a development is currently missing. Therefore, our objective was to document and analyse the development of forest management practices in Spain since the mid-20th century. We developed narratives to describe the trends in 11 indicators of forest management decision-making and practices. Results show that while some decisions have evolved towards promoting multifunctionality (e.g., soil cultivation), others have intensified to maximize production at the expense of other ecosystem services (e.g., naturalness of tree species) and others have not changed much during the past 80 years (e.g., type of regeneration). The analysis also showed that some of the indicators have been conditioned by technological innovations (e.g., machine operation) and by the development of certain policies and legislation (e.g., the application of chemical agents). Based on these trends, we identified the main challenges that forest management in general, and in Spain in particular, may face as well as some decisions that may have to be reconsidered (cutting regime, tree maturity, naturalness of tree species) if the country wants to transition towards alternative silvicultural approaches that promote multifunctionality. In addition, a transition towards mixed-species, uneven-aged forests alongside with genetic improvement of tree species would also facilitate rising to one of the main challenges that forest management faces: to develop a climate-smart forestry that contributes to the mitigation of and adaptation to global change.},

	abstract = {Converting beech coppices into high forest stands has been promoted in the last decades as a management goal to attenuate the negative effects that frequent clearcutting may have on soil, landscape, and biodiversity conservation. The silvicultural tool usually adopted is the gradual thinning of shoots during the long span of time required to complete the conversion, that also allows the owner to keep harvesting some wood. This research reports and discusses, in the light of the ecological intensification approach, the results achieved from an experimental test started more than 25 years ago in a 42-year-old beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) coppice with standards in central Italy. The effects of various thinning intensities (three treatments plus a control) on the stand growth and structure are assessed by successive forest inventories. Analyses are integrated by spatial indices to assess stem density and canopy cover. Converting beech coppices into high forest through gradual thinning of shoots proves to be an effective step down the road to silvicultural systems characterized by continuous forest cover, as a tool of ecological intensification suitable to guarantee both public and private interests. Thinning has led to stands with fewer but larger stems, thus accelerating the long conversion process while maintaining both wood harvesting capability and environmental services.},

	abstract = {In many parts of Europe, close-to-nature silviculture (CNS) has been widely advocated as being the best approach for managing forests to cope with future climate change. In this review, we identify and evaluate six principles for enhancing the adaptive capacity of European temperate forests in a changing climate: (1) increase tree species richness, (2) increase structural diversity, (3) maintain and increase genetic variation within tree species, (4) increase resistance of individual trees to biotic and abiotic stress, (5) replace high-risk stands and (6) keep average growing stocks low. We use these principles to examine how three CNS systems (single-tree selection, group selection and shelterwood) serve adaptation strategies. Many attributes of CNS can increase the adaptive capacity of European temperate forests to a changing climate. CNS promotes structural diversity and tree resistance to stressors, and growing stocks can be kept at low levels. However, some deficiencies exist in relation to the adaptation principles of increasing tree species richness, maintaining and increasing genetic variation, and replacing high-risk stands. To address these shortcomings, CNS should make increased use of a range of regeneration methods, in order to promote light-demanding tree species, non-native species and non-local provenances.},

Studies on European beech to date have not yet investigated the effect of ISS on its genetic diversity and have rarely addressed the effect of management on the genetic diversity of successive generations. The study was conducted in two mixed beech stands in Slovenia; the unmanaged Rajhenavski Rog old-growth European beech forest reserve and beech forest in Osankarica, managed according to ISS. All 140 sampled adult trees and saplings were genotyped at 16 nuclear microsatellite loci. ISS mimics genetic processes of the old growth rather well in the studied managed stand. The comparisons of diversity measures between managed and old growth stands did not reveal any significant differences between the two for any of the cohorts; the differences between the cohorts from the same stand were not significant. The observed significant shift in allele frequencies at four loci between successive generations could not be unambiguously attributed to management. Cohorts from the same stand had similar genetic structure, but six individuals from the managed stand formed a unique cluster. No convincing evidence of the effect of ISS on genetic diversity of the studied managed beech stand was found.},

	abstract = {The historical background, the management practice, growth and yield aspects of transformation of artificial coniferous stands in central Europe are outlined. Past management has reduced the proportion of natural broad-leaved forests from 66 to 33\% of the forest area. The pure stands of planted Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) show increased instability and susceptibility to damage by snow and wind. Proposals for transformation go back to the nineteenth century, but the diversity of sites, stand structures and different goals of owners make transformation a variable task. This paper outlines three case studies of transformation and some results of growth research into transforming coniferous stands, based on the situation in south-western Germany which is comparable to other parts of central Europe. The first case study deals with two experimental stands in the southern Black Forest which have been developed from an even- to an uneven-aged structure. Diameter distribution, residual volumes, harvesting results and periodic increments and yields are characterised. The second case study outlines the transformation of pure Norway spruce stands. On stable sites, an uneven-aged mosaic structure with 20–40\% beech can be reached by crop-tree oriented thinning from above, target-diameter harvesting, natural regeneration and underplanting of beech if needed. On unstable sites, transformation will be realised either by clearfelling and seeding, conversion to oak by planting or by underplanting of silver fir and single-tree harvesting. The third case study deals with pure Scots pine stands: natural regeneration of Scots pine allows transformation options either rather fast in combination with clearfelling and/or seeding, or delayed with lasting regeneration procedures, or as nearly continuous cover system with low density of overstorey. Some growth and yield problems in transforming coniferous stands are shown using the example of the “Langenbrand-experiment”, started in 1927 in the northern Black Forest. There are effects of differing regeneration periods on growth rates caused by the interaction between the old and the young stands. These have an influence on the growth reactions of the residual trees, their mortality and the pattern of height/diameter (h/d) ratios in the natural regeneration. The h/d relationships of the young stands depend on the length of the regeneration period with longer periods promoting more favourable ratios which should positively influence the stability of future stands.},

A wide range of tools and services are now available and constantly evolving to handle vast amounts of available data as well as the increased complexity of real-world case studies and analytical alternatives.

Important steps have been taken to update the forestry sector and introduce new large-scale experimental designs, digital tools and more extensive forestry databases.

              Mixed forests are increasingly recognized for their resilience to climate change and enhanced ecosystem services (ESs) provision, making them a focal point for sustainable forest management strategies. This study examines the trade-offs in ESs provision between pure and different proportions of mixed stands of Scots pine (
              Pinus sylvestris
              L.) and Maritime pine (
              Pinus pinaster
              Ait.) in the Northern Iberian Range, Spain. Using the SIMANFOR simulation platform, we evaluated various silvicultural scenarios developed to obtain different ESs such as carbon sequestration, timber and mushroom yields. Our findings reveal that ESs provision varies depending on the forest type (pure or mixed) and the mixture proportion, following different trends on each ES. The initial species proportions and their maintenance were less critical than the management approach itself, which significantly influenced ESs outcomes. Focusing solely on individual ESs can lead to trade-offs, as highlighted by our study on silviculture focused on large saw timber yields. However, adopting a balanced approach that considers multiple ESs can mitigate these trade-offs. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of this approach in maximizing yields of mushrooms, sequestered carbon, and small saw timber. This research provides valuable insights for forest managers aiming to balance productivity and sustainability in ESs provision, providing strategies to maximize compatible ESs effectively.},
